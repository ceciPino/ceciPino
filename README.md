⚡ My name is María Cecilia (but everyone calls me Ceci) and I'm a Front-End developer based in Santiago, Chile. I find passion in constant learning and growing. Always curious and active, but I also enjoy a good amount of discipline and order 🙆‍♀️
I'm currently finishing the SCL Front-End Bootcamp at Laboratoria Chile, seeking to improve my coding skills and development abilities in creative web designs, with focus on problem solving. 
On these days i'm working on re-doing the Social-Network proyect with React.

🗻 I love living surrounded by mountains and going outdoors. That gave me perspective and the aim to always look at the big picture of things.

💥 Also in my past life I studied Law and almost became an Enviromental Lawyer.

🌱 I use my spare time to listen/enjoy/play music, knit, cook(and be really good at), or just spend time with my loved ones(🐱🐶)
